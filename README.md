# Setup

After you use "git clone https://github.com/quynhluu130502/KhoaLuan.git," you will have a folder named KhoaLuan. Open with VSCode or any editor you have.

Open 2 terminals, one for the client and one for the server.

- On the server, use the command "npm run dev."
- With the client, use the command "ng serve --o."

Note: I do not push the.env from the server folder to Github, and you must have mkcrt to generate a certificate for the HTTPS connection on the server. Contact me at ***viethungitmi@gmail.com*** for more instructions.

# KhoaLuan

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
