# Introduction

This is a project that I developed using someone else's GitHub account. This project is used in the final thesis defense. After the project is completed, the ownership rights are returned to me.
You can experience the demo through:

- Client: https://khoaluan-r8ub.onrender.com
  - The admin account has an account ID of 100000 and a password of 123456.
  - A regular account has an account ID of 100002 and a password 123456.
- Server:https://khoaluanserver.onrender.com
- Demo video:

# Setup

After you use "git clone https://github.com/viethungle0503/KhoaLuan.git," you will have a folder named KhoaLuan. Open with VSCode or any editor you have.

Open 2 terminals, one for the client and one for the server.

- On the server, use the command "npm run dev."
- With the client, use the command "ng serve --o."

Note: I do not push the.env from the server folder to Github, and you must have mkcrt to generate a certificate for the HTTPS connection on the server. Contact me at viethungitmi@gmail.com if you want for more instructions.

# KhoaLuan

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
